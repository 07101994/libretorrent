Coding Guidelines
---

 - Keep it simple, stupid. (KISS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
 - Do not repeat yourself. (DRY: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) Re-use your own code and our code.
 - If you want to help, the Issue tracker and TODO list is a good place to take a look at.
 - Try to follow our coding style and formatting before submitting a patch.
 - All pull requests should come from a feature branch created on your git fork. We'll review your code and will only merge it to the master branch if it doesn't break the build.
 - When you submit a pull request try to explain what issue you're fixing in detail and how you're fixing in detail it so it's easier for us to read your patches.
 - We prefer well named methods and code re-usability than a lot of comments.
